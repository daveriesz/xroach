    Solaris Port

    See the top-level Makefile for details on how to build and install this.
    If you use CDE, you may need to set the screen background
    to "blank" or "none."

    You can always set the background color with xsetroot (e.g.,
    "xsetroot -solid SteelBlue" in .xinitrc or .Xclients).
